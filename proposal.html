        The project I am choosing to update is my 317 app prototype.  For the app we had to do user research and testing as well as make  a prototype and summary video.  The audience is college students mainly, so anyone ages 18-25.  I hope to revamp the front end design for my app because I feel as though the app was a great idea that could be highly useful to college students, but due to lack of time the final product did not look as user friendly as I hoped it would. I will also dive deeper into the user planning and research to find the exact target audience I am looking for and come up with creative solutions to fit their needs.  I think one of the flaws that we had with the app last semester is that we did not test if users would even use the app, and that is an essential part of the entire project.  Additionally, we had features that we concluded that I felt are unnecessary to the app, and I would like to retest those features and make sure they are really needed. If my results come back negative I will make sure to tweak the app so that users would want to use it. By Feb 16 I will have completed all of the new and improved user research and by March 4 I will have redesigned and rebranded the app using Adobe XD. </p>
